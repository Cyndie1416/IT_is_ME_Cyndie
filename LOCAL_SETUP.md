# 🚀 Local Development Setup Guide

## Quick Start (3 Methods)

### Method 1: Simple HTML (30 seconds)
```bash
# Just open the HTML file in your browser
start index.html
```
✅ **Works immediately** - All styling and animations included
❌ Contact form won't submit (needs backend)

### Method 2: Backend Only (1 minute)
```bash
# Start just the API server
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
✅ API available at http://localhost:5000
✅ Test endpoints with browser or Postman

### Method 3: Full Stack (2 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
python app.py

# Terminal 2: Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
✅ Full website at http://localhost:3000
✅ Backend API at http://localhost:5000
✅ Contact form works

## 🔧 What's Already Working

- ✅ Python 3.13.7 installed
- ✅ Node.js v22.18.0 installed  
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Backend starts successfully
- ✅ Frontend builds without errors
- ✅ Responsive design works
- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Mobile navigation
- ✅ Contact form validation

## 🎯 Next Steps to Personalize

1. **Replace placeholder content**:
   - Update email from `hello@cyndie.dev` to your real email
   - Add your actual social media links
   - Replace project descriptions with your real projects

2. **Add your photo**:
   - Replace the profile placeholder in the hero section
   - Update the `profile-placeholder` div with an `<img>` tag

3. **Customize projects**:
   - Edit the projects in `backend/app.py` or `index.html`
   - Add real GitHub/demo links

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend won't start?
```bash
cd backend
python --version  # Should show Python 3.13.7
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Frontend won't start?
```bash
cd frontend
node --version  # Should show v22.18.0
npm install
npm start
```

### Port already in use?
- Backend (port 5000): Change port in `backend/app.py`
- Frontend (port 3000): React will ask to use a different port
